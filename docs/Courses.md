## <a name="data-analysis"></a>Data Analysis with Python, R or SQL

One of the first major decisions to make when getting into data analysis is about which language to choose. This [infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) by Datacamp provides a helpful overview about R and Python and might be a good starting point to inform yourself. 

In terms of courses, we also recommend the courses by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), as they offer [free class accounts](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) that can be applied for by academic instructors.

Some courses we recommend are: (excerpt)

| Course | Category | Level  | Notes  |
|--------|---|---|---|
| [Introduction to Shell](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-shell) | Shell  | Beginner  |   |
| [Introduction to Bash Scripting](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-bash-scripting) | Shell  | Beginner to Intermediate  |   |
| [Introduction to Data Visualization with Plotly in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-plotly-in-python) | Python  | Beginner  |   |
| [Building Dashboards with Dash and Plotly](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/building-dashboards-with-dash-and-plotly) | Python  | Intermediate  |   |   


We also have made good experiences with [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/), especially for other programming languages and use cases beyond data analysis, however, their classroom program is limited to the USA at the time of writing (February 2021).

Furthermore, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a reliable and free of charge platform for learning Python, SQL and the basics of machine and deep learning. Further skills such as data visualization with seaborn and data manipulation with pandas, among others, can also be learned, applied, and solidified through challenges and competitions.

## Twitter API

### [Twitter dev 101 | Getting Started with the Twitter API v2 for academic research](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research)

This [course](https://github.com/twitterdev/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api-v2-for-academic-research) will teach you, step by step, how to set up your Twitter developer account and how to use the Twitter Academic API (v2).
It contains 8 modules including a module dedicated to a lab environment for practical experiences using R or Python.
It also covers the identification of suitable endpoints for your use-cases, how to build better search queries, and storage of Twitter data using R or Python.

## <a name="tdd-python"></a>Test-Driven (Web) Development with Python
