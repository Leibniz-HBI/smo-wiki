# How to edit a page

For editing pages in this Wiki, you need to be logged into a [Github account](https://github.com/).

1. Navigate to the page
2. Click edit
3. The recommended and easiest way to edit this wiki is "Markdown" (in a dropdown above the editor). Tutorials for this can be found [here](https://commonmark.org/help/) (simple, interactive), [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github) and [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (both more detailed, and including Github-specific extras).

# Create and Link to a new page

There are two ways to create a page. Creating a link first (recommended) or creating a page first.

## Create link first

1. When editing a page, you can simply create a link by putting double square brackets around it.
2. By clicking the (red) link on the edited page you will open an editing page for the not yet existing page.
3. If you save the page, all red links to the page will turn blue.

Creating red links to not-yet-existing pages in a text is a good way to mark TO DOs for pages that should exist.

## Create page first

1. In the wiki click "New Page" (somewhere in the upper-right corner)
2. When the page is created and finished you can link to it from other pages via a simple link, e.g. in the Markdown editor like this: `Here is the [new page]]`. This will result in a link to the [[new page](new-page]]`.-This-will-result-in-a-link-to-the-[[new-page).

## Template

You can use this [article template](article-template) to structure your wiki article. 

# Export articles

1. Clone the wiki as a repository with the link provided on the right (e.g. with the Github Desktop Client)
2. The articles will be downloaded as text-files (in Markdown) in the project folder.

# Export to ['pretty' wiki](https://smo-wiki.leibniz-hbi.de)

Only authorised members of the SMO core team with push access to the page's [repository](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/smo-wiki) can do that, following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/smo-wiki/blob/main/README.md#how-to-update-the-pretty-wiki-with-changes-from-the-original-wiki) there. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/smo-wiki/issues) there if you think a change from here needs to be urgently reviewed and included in the pretty version.
