## How to edit a page

1. Navigate to the page
2. Click edit
3. The recommended and easiest way to edit this wiki is "Markdown" (in a dropdown above the editor). Tutorials for this can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github)-and-[here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Create and Link to a new page

There are two ways to create a page. Creating a link first (recommended) or creating a page first.

### Create link first

1. When editing a page, you can simply create a link like this: `Here is a [not yet existing page](not-yet-existing-page)`.
2. By clicking the (red) link on the edited page you will open an editing page for the [not yet existing page](not-yet-existing-page).
3. If you save the page, all red links to the page will turn blue.

Creating red links to not-yet-existing pages in a text is a good way to mark TO DOs for pages that should exist.

### Create page first

1. In the wiki click "New Page" (somewhere in the upper-right corner)
2. When the page is created and finished you can link to it from other pages via a simple link, e.g. in the Markdown editor like this: `Here is the [new page]]`. This will result in a link to the [[new page](new-page]]`.-This-will-result-in-a-link-to-the-[[new-page).

## Export articles

1. Clone the wiki as a repository with the link provided on the right (e.g. with the Github Desktop Client)
2. The articles will be downloaded as text-files (in Markdown) in the project folder.
