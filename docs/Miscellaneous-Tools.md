# Miscellaneous Tools

Welcome to the Miscellaneous Tools page.

This page is dedicated to all tools that are not related to any kind of social network that we have covered so far (or all of them together). These tools vary from web-based application to tools that need a local installation. This list is not in any specific order. All tools you find in this list have been tested. If you still face any problems with the tools bellow, make sure to add an [issue to our repository](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/issues). It helps us to maintain this list.
