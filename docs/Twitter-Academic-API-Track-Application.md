2. Make yourself familiar with Twitter's TOS and especially [restricted use cases](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases) in order to assess whether your research can be approved under those terms.
3. Get a Twitter account if you don't have one already. Better: associate your existing account with your academic institution's email address. This is not a requirement, but we think it might help in getting approved, as platforms tend to take into account if an account already exists for a while in order to prevent fraud. The association with the institute's email address is, again, just another indicator that your request is legit.
