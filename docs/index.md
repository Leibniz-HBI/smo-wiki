# Welcome to the Social-Media-Observatory wiki!

Are you interested in research with social media data and are don't really know where to start, or are you already working with it and need help? 
This wiki is the central knowledge and documentation base of the Social Media Observatory (SMO). It is aimed at providing you with an overview and guidelines on how to work responsibly with social media data in the most convenient way possible: From an overview of the options and tools for scraping, mining, and analyzing data on various social media platforms, to guidance and training on how to use them, to questions about ethics and the law, and more - we try to support your research process from start to finish.

The bleeding-edge, editable version can be found [here](https://github.com/leibniz-hbi/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki), the less frequently updated, but better reviewed, 'pretty' version waits [here](https://leibniz-hbi.github.io/smo-wiki/).

## Blank Spots in the Wiki

Because we're just starting out, some sections are not much more than a heading. So here are some explanations what to expect there.

### Research Ethics and Law

We are working on and invite contributions to this section, where we plan to collect advice on common issues when working with (social) media data.

### Knowledge Base

Also, if you have basic, but crucial, social media knowledge to share (for example overall measurement baselines for certain platforms or demographics) or examples of instructive (un)successful case studies (not necessarily your own), feel free to create the first pages in the [Knowledge Base](Knowledge-Base) section.
* [Case Studies](Case-Studies): Examples for data analytics in computational communication research
* [Projects](Projects): A selection of current projects to be aware of
