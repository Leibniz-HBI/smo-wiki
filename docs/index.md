# Welcome to the Social-Media-Observatory wiki!

This wiki is the central knowledge and documentation base of the SMO. The bleeding-edge, editable version can be found [here](https://github.com/leibniz-hbi/Social-Media-Observatory/wiki), the less frequently updated, but better reviewed, 'pretty' version waits [here](https://leibniz-hbi.github.io/smo-wiki/).

## Code of Conduct

By contributing to this wiki you agree to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Leibniz-HBI/Social-Media-Observatory/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Blank Spots in the Wiki

Because we're just starting out, some sections are not much more than a heading. So here are some explanations what to expect there.

### [Research Ethics and Law](Research-Ethics-and-Law)

We are working on and invite contributions to this section, where we plan to collect advice on common issues when working with (social) media data.

### [Knowledge Base](Knowledge-Base)

Also, if you have basic, but crucial, social media knowledge to share (for example overall measurement baselines for certain platforms or demographics) or examples of instructive (un)successful case studies (not necessarily your own), feel free to create the first pages in the [Knowledge Base](Knowledge-Base) section.
* [Case Studies](Case-Studies): Examples for data analytics in computational communication research
* [Projects](Projects): A selection of current projects to be aware of


## 👏💫🏆 Wall of Fame 🏆💫👏

We have an ongoing authorship statistic that will be used to acknowledge authors in future publications based on this wiki (e.g. in form of a citations for a Figshare or OSF project):

🌟🌟🌟 **[The Wall of Fame](https://smo-wiki.leibniz-hbi.de/wall-of-fame)** 🌟🌟🌟

If you want to be properly acknowledged, make sure to use your clear name on Github when editing. Otherwise it'll be hard for us to properly acknowledge you. However, pseudonymous contributions are always welcome and will be counted.
